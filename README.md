# Javascript homework. Password Generator

## Purpose

This repository contains the javascript password generator. I put extra effort into developing a method to ensure that each character type selected would be used. If the random generation misses one of the character types, it will re-generate the password again untill it gets a valid password. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Make modifications to html, assets, and css as necessary
3. Push the changes to your repository or host 

## Usage
click the 'generate password' button to create a password and follow the on screen prompts. The copy button will copy the generated password to your clipboard.
